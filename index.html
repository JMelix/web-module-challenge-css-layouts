I discharged the service honarable at the rank of Sergeant. Shortly after I began a career as a correctional officer for the federal government where I served 15 years. During My time as a correctional officer I attending school at the University of Phoenix for computer networking. It was there where I took my first coding class and fell in love with code. The class involved HTML, CSS, and a bit of javaScript. I am now currently enrolled and attending Bloom Institute of Technology, which has me designing this awesome portfolio site. My goals involve furthering my future by obtaining a career as a full stack web developer!</p>
